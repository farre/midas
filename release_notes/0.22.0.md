# Release 0.22.0

## Fixes

- Fixed bug that made `Add to watch` disappear for member objects in the `Variables` list. You can now right click things
  in the list and add sub objects to `Watch` again.

## Features
- Added `(Return Value)` variable to `Locals`, if the last command that executed was `stepOut` and it succeeded completely.
  This way you can inspect return values from a function.
- Added `LogPoint` breakpoints that logs to the debug console and continues.
