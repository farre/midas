# Release 0.25.0

## Features

- Support for [Pacman](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman) ([libalpm](https://man.archlinux.org/man/libalpm.3) via [pyalpm](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/pyalpm) in reality). This enables toolchain support on Arch Linux based distributions.

- Workflows for publishing through GitHub Actions. This doesn't really affect the extension itself, but streamlines releases to [GitHub](https://github.com/farre/midas/releases), [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=farrese.midas) and [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/farrese/midas).
