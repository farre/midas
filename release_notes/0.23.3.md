# Release 0.23.3

## Features
- Added `ignoreStandardLibrary` to launch and attach configurations. It will attempt at ignoring most c++ standard library headers while stepping. It's a best approximation approach. Defaults to `true`. If you want to add additional files from the standard library, add `"skip file foo"`, `"skip file bar"`, ... to the `setupCommands` field.


## Fixes
- Fixes to UI to behave more consistent.
- Refactor of tool management, so that it can be extended to additional software like GDB as well (in the future) in-house debugger, caused Midas to ask every time for updates of tools even when having updated to last version. Fixed.
- Fixed hex-formatting bug for register values with the sign bit set.
- Make disassemble only disassemble functions and don't allow for scroll-disassembling as this caused jank and bugs. New system not perfect, but does not produce invalid results
