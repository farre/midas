# Release 0.23.3

## Features
- Added `ignoreStandardLibrary` to launch and attach configurations. It will attempt at ignoring most c++ standard library headers while stepping. It's a best approximation approach. Defaults to `true`. If you want to add additional files from the standard library, add `"skip file foo"`, `"skip file bar"`, ... to the `setupCommands` field.


## Fixes
- Fixes to UI to behave more consistent.
