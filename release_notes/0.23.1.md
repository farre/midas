# Release 0.23.1

## Fixes

- Make validation of config happen after substition of variables like ${workspaceFolder} so that _any_ configuration items can use the short-hands/built ins
- Refactors and cleaning up the inherent messiness of supporting what essentially is 3 backends; midas-native (mdb, future hopefully mdb+rr), midas-gdb (gdb) and midas-rr (gdb+rr).

## Features

- Extended support for the debugger backend "midas" which henceforth will be known as "midas-native"
