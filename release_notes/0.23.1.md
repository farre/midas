# Release 0.23.1

## Fixes

- Make validation of config happen after substition of variables like ${workspaceFolder} so that _any_ configuration items can use the short-hands/built ins
- Refactors and cleaning up the inherent messiness of supporting what essentially is 3 backends; midas-native (mdb, future hopefully mdb+rr), midas-gdb (gdb) and midas-rr (gdb+rr).
- Added program args as a configuration item for launched program when `use-dap` is true, which seems to have been missing

## Features

- Extended support for the debugger backend "midas" which henceforth will be known as "midas-native"
- Added context menu support for call stack, to resume/pause all threads
- Make use of onActive item events so that the debugger backends can know what threads the user is inspecting in the UI
- Added continueAll
- Added pauseAll
- continueAll/pauseAll is used for gdb's allStopMode, or MDB.
- Deprecated allStopMode in launch.json; use noSingleThreadControl instead. It's a better name and will
  be also what this feature eventually be called by MDB.
- ${workspaceFolder} and built-ins in launch.json, should now work for all sorts of config field values
